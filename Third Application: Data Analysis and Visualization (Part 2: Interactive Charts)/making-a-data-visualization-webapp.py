    # We will add HighChart (another JustPy componenent) Graph. For choosing which graph we need, go to:
    # https://www.highcharts.com/docs/index > Charts and Series Types - HighCharts is a JavaScript Library 
    # to produce Graphs. 
    # Same as Quasar, which is another JavaScript Library, whoever it is unrelated to HighCharts.
    # Python is getting these 2 JavaScript Frameworks together. 

    # In our case, we will use Spline Chart: https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/spline-chart 
    # For this, we need the JavaScript code, so we open the chart in jsFiddle (upper-right corner of the graph),
    # and copy JS code after "   Highcharts.chart('container',   "   All the WAY to the last curly bracket (}) - and
    # we will paste it in our variable chart_def from above ^^^.

    hc = jp.HighCharts(a=wp, options=chart_def) # We will create our HighChart here.

    # Above 2 prints will only print (on VS Code Terminal, or whethever you run the script from) after we access the page.

    ###print(type(hc.options))

   # x = [3, 6, 8]
   # y = [4, 7, 9]
    ###hc.options.series[0].data = list(zip(x, y)) # Will produce: [(3,4), (6,7), (8,9)]

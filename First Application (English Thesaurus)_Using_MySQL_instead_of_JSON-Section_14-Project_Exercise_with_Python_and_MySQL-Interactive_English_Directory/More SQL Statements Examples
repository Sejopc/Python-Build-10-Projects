In the example you just saw, we used the following SQL statement in our Python code:

query = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE Expression = 'rain'")
That statement retrieved all the rows of the Dictionary table where the value of the column Expression was rain. The string inside cursor.execute() is SQL code that Python sends to the database. The database understands that kind of language.

Here are some more examples of SQL queries that you can try out from within your Python script just like we did previously:

Get all rows where the value of the column Expression starts with r:

"SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE Expression  LIKE 'r%'"
Get all rows where the value of the column Expression starts with rain:

"SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE Expression  LIKE 'rain%'"
All rows where the length of the value of the column Expression is less than four characters:

"SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE length(Expression) < 4"
All rows where the length of the value of the column Expression is four characters:

"SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE length(Expression) = 4"
All rows where the length of the value of the column Expression is greater than 1 but less than 4 characters:

"SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE length(Expression) > 1 AND length(Expression) < 4"
All rows of column Definition where the value of the column Expression starts with r:

"SELECT Definition FROM Dictionary WHERE Expression  LIKE 'r%'"
